Create TWO new components: UserInput and UserOutput
UserInput should hold an input element, UserOutput two paragraphs
Output multiple UserOutput components in the App component (any paragraph texts of your choice)
Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there
Add state to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component
Add a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method)
Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event
Ensure that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username passed to UserOutput
Add two-way-binding to your input (in UserInput) to also display the starting username
Add styling of your choice to your components/ elements in the components - both with inline styles and stylesheets


1. Create an input field (in App component) with a change listener which outputs the length of the entered text below it (ex: in a paragraph)
2. Create a new component (=> validationComponent) which receives the text length as a prop
3. Inside the ValidationComponent, either output "Text too short" or "Text long enough" depending on the text length (ex. takes 5 as a minimum length)
4. Create another component ( => CharComponent) and style it as an inline box (=>display:inline-block, padding:16px, text-align:center, margin:16px, border:1px solid black)
5. Render a list of CharComponents where each CharComponent receives a different letter of the entered text (in the initial input field) as a prop
6. when you click a CharComponent, it should be removed from the entered text
